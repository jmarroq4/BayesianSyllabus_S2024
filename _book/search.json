This course will further student knowledge in the General Linear Model to allow students to evaluate assumptions, deal with group comparisons, work with repeated measures, and address moderation and mediation. The class meetings will consist mostly of lectures and discussions. The lab assignments will focus on providing you with hands-on experience analyzing data and interpreting results.",

Thus, I plan to create a collaborative learning environment that mimics the real world. We will all be part of a team and our job is to complete three projects.

The projects will be graded and the grades will be based on the quality of the work and the timeliness of the work.",

Each day, I intend to take a picture of the participants at 9:10a. Please make every effort to attend and attend on time. Thank you.\n\n\nActive Participation (25%)\nYes, participate. You cannot learn if you do not participate in the discussions and activities. So, given that you plan to attend, you might as well participate. I do intend to call on those who do not contribute often. We need to make this course more interactive. Please come prepared to talk about the material in the assigned readings.\n\n\nAssignments (25%)\nEach of you will have assigned duties for each project. The projects require you to work in one large group (entire class including me). Your responsibility is to complete the tasks you were assigned. If they are too burdensome at any point, it is your responsibility to communicate with the team. If you do not complete your tasks, you will not receive credit for the assignment and, as a result, the project will not be completed on time so the entire team suffers. Thus, do your assigned task.

Decisions regarding extensions and make-ups under these circumstances will be made on a case-by-case basis. In general, quizzes are not eligible for make-up work; instead, your two lowest quiz grades are automatically dropped. Lab homework is penalized at 5% per day for late submission (i.e., starting when lab time begins) and receives no credit if it is submitted over a week late. When possible, I encourage students to reach out as soon as you know that you may miss class and/or related work; it is much easier to develop a plan in advance than it is to do so later.",

    "text": "Project 2: Measurement Error\nMost of us think of measurement error as the result of a mistake (accident during data collection), omission (relevant variable, coherent model, range, etc.), or bias. Some of us know better. To capture the essence of what measurement error is (and is not), we shall undertake a deep dive into a simple measurement model. The actual data source will be revealed in time but the data represent a simple instantiation of a common problem. We have XXX unique participant data who completed a measure that was administered across 8 or 16 vignettes.\nBut, in fact, measurement error is a fundamental part of the process of measurement. We will explore this idea in the context of a simple linear regression model. We will use the same tools as in Project 1.\n\n\n\n\nAntognini, Joe. 2021. “Understanding Stein’s Paradox.” https://joe-antognini.github.io/machine-learning/steins-paradox.\n\n\nBerg, Arthur. 2021. “Bayesian Modeling Competitions for the Classroom.” Revista Colombiana de Estadística 44 (2): 243252.\n\n\nClark, Michael. 2019. “Michael Clark: Shrinkage in Mixed Effects Models,” May. https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-05-14-shrinkage-in-mixed-models/.\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Carl Morris. 1977. “Stein’s Paradox in Statistics.” Scientific American 236 (5): 119–27. https://www.jstor.org/stable/24954030.\n\n\nKeil, Alexander P., Eric J.

You need all six entities installed and configured to be functionally enrolled in this course. Thus, we need to get you all setup before I can start distributing things like…this syllabus and my weekly notes. So, let’s get started.\nFirst, get R (aka our engine for this course). Go to CRAN and download the latest version of R for your operating system. Install R. Then install RStudio. Go to RStudio and download the latest version of RStudio for your operating system. Then, install RStudio.  Once you have a functional RStudio environment, go to the Quarto website and follow the instructions to install Quarto. Finally, install Git. Go to Git and download the latest version of Git for your operating system. Install Git. If you want to use GitHub Desktop, go to GitHub Desktop and download the latest version of GitHub Desktop for your operating system. Install GitHub Desktop - again, optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet a GitHub account (and send to me)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use GitHub to store all of our files, including the project reports. Thus, you will need to get comfortable with GitHub. I will help you with this process.\nSign yourself up for a github account. Once you get your username, please send it to me via email. I will add you to the course organization and you will be able to access the course repository (a set of files stored on the cloud). Once you have access to the course repository, you will be able to clone (copy) the repository to your computer. You can even edit these files! Thus, the addition of you to the group repository enables you to participate in the course. Don’t worry about using the tool right now, we will build in a routine for each day, week, and quarter(ish) to help you easily get into the flow of things. GitHub allows us to work together in a more efficient manner - compared to Google docs, for example. We will use GitHub to store all of our files, including the project reports. Thus, you will need to get comfortable with GitHub. Again, I will help you with this process. - Get your PAT setup. See this page for more details. - Add your PAT to your credential manager. See this page for more details. - Test your setup.\n\n\n\n\nClone the course repository\n\n\nOpen RStudio and set up Git\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open it. Then, go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN. Click on the box next to “Enable version control interface for RStudio projects”. Then, click on the box next to “Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt”. Then, click on the box next to “Use a custom Git executable” and navigate to the Git executable on your computer. Finally, click on the box next to “View project status in the RStudio project”. Click “OK”. You are now ready to use Git with RStudio.\nIf you want a more, in depth, tutorial on how to use Git with RStudio, go to Happy Git and GitHub for the useR and follow the instructions. I highly recommend this outstanding resource for learning how to use Git with RStudio.\n\n\nClone this repository\nYes, you gotta try sometime. Use the following steps to clone this repository to your computer.\n\nOpen RStudio\nGo to File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git\nPaste the following URL into the “Repository URL” box:\n\n\n\nOpen the project in RStudio\n\n\nRender the syllabus & read (often)",
