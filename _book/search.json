This course will further student knowledge in the General Linear Model to allow students to evaluate assumptions, deal with group comparisons, work with repeated measures, and address moderation and mediation. The class meetings will consist mostly of lectures and discussions. The lab assignments will focus on providing you with hands-on experience analyzing data and interpreting results.",

Thus, I plan to create a collaborative learning environment that mimics the real world. We will all be part of a team and our job is to complete three projects.

The projects will be graded and the grades will be based on the quality of the work and the timeliness of the work.",

Each day, I intend to take a picture of the participants at 9:10a. Please make every effort to attend and attend on time. Thank you.\n\n\nActive Participation (25%)\nYes, participate. You cannot learn if you do not participate in the discussions and activities. So, given that you plan to attend, you might as well participate.

Please come prepared to talk about the material in the assigned readings.\n\n\nAssignments (25%)\nEach of you will have assigned duties for each project. The projects require you to work in one large group (entire class including me). Your responsibility is to complete the tasks you were assigned. If they are too burdensome at any point, it is your responsibility to communicate with the team. If you do not complete your tasks, you will not receive credit for the assignment and, as a result, the project will not be completed on time so the entire team suffers. Thus, do your assigned task.

Decisions regarding extensions and make-ups under these circumstances will be made on a case-by-case basis. In general, quizzes are not eligible for make-up work; instead, your two lowest quiz grades are automatically dropped. Lab homework is penalized at 5% per day for late submission (i.e., starting when lab time begins) and receives no credit if it is submitted over a week late. When possible, I encourage students to reach out as soon as you know that you may miss class and/or related work; it is much easier to develop a plan in advance than it is to do so later.",

    "text": "Project 2: Measurement Error\nMost of us think of measurement error as the result of a mistake (accident during data collection), omission (relevant variable, coherent model, range, etc.), or bias. Some of us know better. To capture the essence of what measurement error is (and is not), we shall undertake a deep dive into a simple measurement model. The actual data source will be revealed in time but the data represent a simple instantiation of a common problem. We have XXX unique participant data who completed a measure that was administered across 8 or 16 vignettes.\nBut, in fact, measurement error is a fundamental part of the process of measurement. We will explore this idea in the context of a simple linear regression model. We will use the same tools as in Project 1.\n\n\n\n\nAntognini, Joe. 2021. “Understanding Stein’s Paradox.” https://joe-antognini.github.io/machine-learning/steins-paradox.\n\n\nBerg, Arthur. 2021. “Bayesian Modeling Competitions for the Classroom.” Revista Colombiana de Estadística 44 (2): 243252.\n\n\nClark, Michael. 2019. “Michael Clark: Shrinkage in Mixed Effects Models,” May. https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-05-14-shrinkage-in-mixed-models/.\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Carl Morris. 1977. “Stein’s Paradox in Statistics.” Scientific American 236 (5): 119–27. https://www.jstor.org/stable/24954030.\n\n\nKeil, Alexander P., Eric J.

    "text": "STEP 1: Install the Tools\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use R, RStudio, Python, Quarto, Git, and GitHub (Desktop if desired). You need all six entities installed and configured to be functionally enrolled in this course. Thus, we need to get you all setup before I can start distributing things like…this syllabus and my weekly notes. So, let’s get started.\nFirst, get R (aka our engine for this course). Go to CRAN and download the latest version of R for your operating system. Install R. Then install RStudio. Go to RStudio and download the latest version of RStudio for your operating system. Then, install RStudio.  Once you have a functional RStudio environment, go to the Quarto website and follow the instructions to install Quarto. Finally, install Git. Go to Git and download the latest version of Git for your operating system. Install Git. If you want to use GitHub Desktop, go to GitHub Desktop and download the latest version of GitHub Desktop for your operating system. Install GitHub Desktop - again, optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: Get a GitHub account (and send to me)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use GitHub to store all of our files, including the project reports. Thus, you will need to get comfortable with GitHub. I will help you with this process.\nSign yourself up for a github account. Once you get your username, please send it to me via email. I will add you to the course organization and you will be able to access the course repository (a set of files stored on the cloud). Once you have access to the course repository, you will be able to clone (copy) the repository to your computer. You can even edit these files! Thus, the addition of you to the group repository enables you to participate in the course. Don’t worry about using the tool right now, we will build in a routine for each day, week, and quarter(ish) to help you easily get into the flow of things. GitHub allows us to work together in a more efficient manner - compared to Google docs, for example. We will use GitHub to store all of our files, including the project reports. Thus, you will need to get comfortable with GitHub. Again, I will help you with this process. - Get your PAT setup. See this page for more details. - Add your PAT to your credential manager. See this page for more details. - Test your setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: Open RStudio and set up Git\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open it. Then, go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN. Click on the box next to “Enable version control interface for RStudio projects”. Windows Users (Then, click on the box next to “Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt”, click on the box next to “Use a custom Git executable” and navigate to the Git executable on your computer). Mac/Linux Users select the git executable that RStudio found in your path. If there is no executable, go back and install git. Finally, for all users, click on the box next to “View project status in the RStudio project”. Click “OK”. You are now ready to use Git with RStudio.\nIf you want a more, in depth, tutorial on how to use Git with RStudio, go to Happy Git and GitHub for the useR and follow the instructions. I highly recommend this outstanding resource for learning how to use Git with RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: Clone the course repository\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the easiest part. Once your system is setup and configured to use all the tools, you can now issue the following commands:\n\n# Clone the course repository\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nusethis::use_course(\"pem725/BayesianSyllabus_S2024\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 5: Render the syllabus & read (often)\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen ANY of the qmd files - probably index.qmd is the most logical choice. Then, click on the “Render” button that will create a wonderful document to your right. If you click on the button that says “Show in new window”, you will have a lovely full-screen version of this beauty. Throughout the semester, I will update this book. Simply do a fresh pull with the same code in the same directory and you will have the most up-to-date version of the syllabus and notes. The \\(usethis\\) (Wickham et al. 2023) package is quite handy.",

Then, click on the “Pull” button in the Git tab; doing so will refresh your local files and enable you to render the full set of notes. You will need to do this before you start working on the weekly assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the assigned readings (before Tuesday each week; 4 hours max/week)\n\n\n\nYep, read the assigned readings BEFORE class. Remember, you get to choose. I have two books. One is a light read with great examples (Kurt 2019); the other is a bit dense with tons of code (McElreath 2020). Either one suffices for the course. If you have a keen interest in applying these tools to your own work, I strongly recommend the latter. You choose. But please read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite down your questions from the assigned readings\n\n\n\nAs you read, note any questions you have regarding terminology, concepts, or applications. These questions will be used for discussion during our Tuesday sessions. Your questions will also help me address any issues you may have with the material. I will do my best to answer your questions in a timely manner. If I cannot answer your question, I will find someone who can. I will also use your questions to help me improve the course. Thus, your questions are important. Please write them down and ask them during class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork on the weekly assignment (before Thursday each week; 4 hours max/week)\n\n\n\nOpen up RStudio every day and get accustomed to the workflow. There is a lot you learn simply by repetition. So, lather, rinse, repeat. You can do it. These initial workflow steps are ones that translate to every area of your life. Break things down into repeatable chunks, commit them to a memorable sequence, and stick to it. You will be amazed at what you can accomplish.",

Students may use Generative AI tools whenever they believe it would be useful to their learning of course material. Students will be directed if and when citation or a statement-of-usage is required. All academic integrity violations will be reported to the office of Academic Integrity.\nFor many learning to program, the use of these tools can greatly speed up your learning; their use may also inhibit your growth. If you find “learning” easier with these tools, you may be missing out on the learning that comes from the struggle of learning to program. If you find yourself using these tools, you should consider whether you are using them to learn or to avoid learning. If you are using these tools to avoid learning, you should consider whether you are using them to avoid the struggle of learning.
